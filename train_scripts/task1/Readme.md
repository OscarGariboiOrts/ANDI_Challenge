All training scripts used for Task1 models training can be found in this folder.

generate_dataset_bloques.py was used to generate datasets with trajectories length comprised between minimum and maximum length.

The following amount of trajectories were generated and used to train the models depending of the length of the trajectories:
  - 8 million trajectories with length between 10 and 20.
  - 6 million trajectories with length between 20 and 30.
  - 2 million trajectories with length between 30 and 40.
  - 2 million trajectories with length between 40 and 50.
  - 2 million trajectories with length between 50 and 100.
  - 2 million trajectories with length between 100 and 200.
  - 2 million trajectories with length between 200 and 300.
  - 2 million trajectories with length between 300 and 400.
  - 2 million trajectories with length between 400 and 500.
  - 2 million trajectories with length between 500 and 600.
  - 2 million trajectories with length between 600 and 800.
  - 2 million trajectories with length between 800 and 1000.
